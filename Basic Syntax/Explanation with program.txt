Explanation:
For Loop:

The for loop runs a block of code a specified number of times. 
In this example, it initializes i to 1, checks if i is less than or equal to 5, and increments i by 1 after each iteration.
The loop will print numbers from 1 to 5.

While Loop:

The while loop runs as long as a specified condition is true. 
In this case, it prints the value of j and increments it by 1 each time, until j becomes greater than 5.
The loop will also print numbers from 1 to 5.

Do-While Loop:

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code runs at least once, even if the condition is initially false. 
The condition is checked after the loop's body has executed.
This loop will print numbers from 1 to 5.
